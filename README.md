 Bulls and Cows Game 

A fun terminal-based number guessing game built using Python!  
**Bulls and Cows** is a classic logical game where you try to guess a secret number based on feedback in terms of “bulls” and “cows”.



How to Play:

- The computer generates a random 4-digit number (all digits are unique).
- You try to guess the number.
- For each guess, you'll receive:
  - **Bulls** – Correct digits in the correct position.
  - **Cows** – Correct digits but in the wrong position.
- The game continues until you guess the number exactly (i.e., 4 bulls).
